# miGiG - Tailored for the youth

Youth unemployment in South Africa is at a staggering 56%, the highest in the world. Current job sourcing methods to eradicate this problem such as online job searching sites are inefficient, outdated and not tailored for the youth nor small business.
miGiG is a micro-job social solution that allows any user on the platform such as small businesses/individuals with temporary work such as catering, gardening, tutoring etc... to advertise it on the platform and a user looking for work matching that which was advertised to apply for it. Platform users will receive notifications of job contracts via Facebook inbox.
